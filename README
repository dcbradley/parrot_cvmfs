This repository is for integration work required to support access to
CVMFS in parrot.

The sourcecode tarballs for CVMFS and parrot were downloaded and
checked into the 'upstream' branch.  The following versions are
currently used:

cvmfs-2.0.4
cctools-1644

So to see the development that has been done, compare the master
branch to the upstream branch:

git diff upstream..master -- cctools
git diff upstream..master -- cvmfs
