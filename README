This repository is for integration work required to support access to
CVMFS in parrot.  All modifications and additions in this repository
made to code in cvmfs are subject to the license in cvmfs/COPYING
(BSD).  All modifications and additions in this repository made to
code in cctools are subject to the license in cctools/COPYING (GPLv2).

The CVMFS and parrot code was checked out from the project
subversion repositories and was copied into the 'upstream' branch.
The following versions are currently used:

cvmfs trunk r3371
cctools trunk r2354

To see the development that has been done, compare the master
branch to the upstream branch:

git diff upstream..master -- cctools
git diff upstream..master -- cvmfs

The code in cvmfs/cvmfs/src/cvmfs_common.cc is intended to
be shared between the FUSE module and libcvmfs.  However,
to avoid making large changes to the current CVMFS trunk,
making cvmfs.cc depend on cvmfs_common.cc has been postponed
for the future.  To see the small changes that were made
to code copied from cvmfs.cc into cvmfs_common.cc:

diff -up cvmfs/cvmfs/src/cvmfs.cc cvmfs/cvmfs/src/cvmfs_common.cc
