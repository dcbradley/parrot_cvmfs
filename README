This repository is for integration work required to support access to
CVMFS in parrot.  All modifications and additions in this repository
made to code in cvmfs are subject to the license in cvmfs/COPYING
(BSD).  All modifications and additions in this repository made to
code in cctools are subject to the license in cctools/COPYING (GPLv2).

The CVMFS and parrot code was checked out from the project
subversion repositories and was copied into the 'upstream' branch.
The following versions are currently used:

cvmfs git repo 886c7c67cb0d (2.1 dev branch)
cctools trunk r2147

To see the development that has been done, compare the cvmfs2_1
branch to the upstream cvmfs2_1 branch:

git diff upstream_cvmfs2_1..cvmfs2_1 -- cctools
git diff upstream_cvmfs2_1..cvmfs2_1 -- cvmfs


To build:

cd cvmfs
cmake -DBUILD_SERVER:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_CVMFS:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_LIBCVMFS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/install .
make install
cd ..

cd cctools
./configure --without-system-sand --without-system-allpairs --without-system-wavefront --without-system-makeflow --with-cvmfs-path `pwd`/../cvmfs/install
make
cd ..


To test:

. test/setup.sh
cd cctools/parrot/src
./parrot_run ls -l /cvmfs/cms.hep.wisc.edu
./parrot_run ls -l /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
