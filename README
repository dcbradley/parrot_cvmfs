This repository is for integration work required to support access to
CVMFS in parrot.  All modifications made in this repository to CVMFS
and cctools are subject to the license in cctools/COPYING (GPLv2).

The sourcecode tarballs for CVMFS and parrot were downloaded and
checked into the 'upstream' branch.  The following versions are
currently used:

cvmfs-2.0.4
cctools-1644

To see the development that has been done, compare the master
branch to the upstream branch:

git diff upstream..master -- cctools
git diff upstream..master -- cvmfs

To build:

cd cvmfs
./configure --disable-server --enable-sqlite3-builtin --enable-libcurl-builtin
make

cd ../cctools
./configure --without-system-sand --without-system-allpairs --without-system-wavefront --without-system-makeflow --with-cvmfs-path `pwd`/../cvmfs
make


To test:

cd parrot/src
./parrot_run cat /cvmfs/cms.hep.wisc.edu/osg/app/etc/grid3-locations.txt
